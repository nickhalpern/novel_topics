# Novel Topics

## Data Source and Objectives
I am interested in modeling the topics that novelists write about, how the frequency of topics changes over time, and whether these topics are reflective of the reality of the period.

My data source is Project Gutenberg, which has over 40,000 English language books.  Many of these are not novels, so to filter down the universe I restricted the list to books whose authors appear on wikipedia's lists of British and American authors.
